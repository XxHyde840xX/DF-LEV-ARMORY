THE LEVIATHAN ARMORY & EMPORIUM - v1.2FINAL - Shipment One - For v0.47.04 - DFHack_r2
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================

Download Location: https://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=15182

Installation Instructions: Before you install the mod, please ensure that you have selected the graphics pack you wish to use beforehand. Then,
						   simply copy both the "hack" and "raw" folders from my mod into your Dwarf Fortress folder. That's it! You're all done! 
						   Please remember to make a copy of your game files in case you would like to revert to "vanilla" Dwarf Fortress.
						   Some tweaks require additional steps. Please see the Table of Contents for instructions if applicable.
						   Please keep this README on hand for future reference.
						   
						   Now, get out there and STRIKE THE EARTH!

===========================================================================================================================================================================================================

=========================================
WHAT IS THIS MOD?
=========================================		
				   
This is the first in a series of planned shipments from The Leviathan Armory & Emporium, now menacing with spikes of revisions! Shipment One
contains a variety of weapons, armor, shields, reactions, tweaks, "fixes," and other odds and ends. I will be building on this project with
additional shipments coming in the future. To see what's going on with the mod and any upcoming content, make suggestions, or get involved with
the project, please check out the Bay 12 Forums thread: http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=177136.0 - Any constructive feedback is
always appreciated, I hope to improve and keep generating new content for the community.

The weapons and armor have not received extensive testing, however, I have based their tokens on several well known weapons and armor packs,
and have used the stock object raws as a baseline. While intended for use by the dwarven race, there is no reason why they can't be utilized
elsewhere. Unfortunately that is beyond the scope of The Leviathan Armory & Emporium at this current time. If there are any oddities in their
behavior or performance, as well as any changes, improvements, tweaks, or suggestions you may have, please get at me on the Bay 12 Forums, or
on Discord.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will always endeavor to ensure that my content is safe, and as compatible and user-friendly as possible, however;

Bumblebee Mead Fix + Honey & Wax from Bumblebees.
--------------------------------------------------

v47.04 - Courtesy of XxHyde840xX

For the purposes of this mod, the reaction has been replaced with my edited version. If you'd like to tweak an
existing save, or use this as a resource, a quick rundown of how I've done this can be found below.

	[ARTIFICIAL_HIVEABLE] token added to bumblebees in creature_insects.txt

The addition above should enable harvesting of both wax and honey, and the brewing of bumblebee mead.

	[REAGENT:honey:150:LIQUID_MISC:NONE:CREATURE_MAT:HONEY_BEE:HONEY] changed to
	[REAGENT:honey:150:LIQUID_MISC:NONE:NONE:NONE] in reaction_other.txt

		[FOOD_STORAGE_CONTAINER] barrel or any non-absorbing tool with FOOD_STORAGE
		[PRESERVE_REAGENT]
		[DOES_NOT_DETERMINE_PRODUCT_AMOUNT]
	[PRODUCT:100:5:DRINK:NONE:GET_MATERIAL_FROM_REAGENT:honey:DRINK_MAT]
		[PRODUCT_TO_CONTAINER:barrel/pot]
		[PRODUCT_DIMENSION:150]
	[SKILL:BREWING]
	
	"[REAGENT:honey:150:LIQUID_MISC:NONE:CREATURE_MAT:HONEY_BEE:HONEY]" changed to
	"[REAGENT:honey:150:LIQUID_MISC:NONE:NONE:NONE]" in reaction_other.txt

This should work on an existing savefile, since I haven't added new reactions to the entity, just changed one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=======
{PIXI}
=======

creature_standard.txt

Ahh, the random tweak to enable trappable fairies and pixies. I did this as an experiment to see if I could get one to
live inside of a dwarves beard as a pet. Let me know if you manage to make it happen!

All I've done here is remove the [VERMIN_NOTRAP] token from both pixies and fairies in the creature_standard.txt file.

Then, I went and added the [PET_EXOTIC] token to both.

Again, as I've only changed an existing creature token, this should work on an existing savefile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=======
{ANIM}
=======


Over 200 animals in the base game have been altered to enable war-training, hunting-training, or have been modified to be mountable
as well. I have tried to ensure that the [MOUNT], [MOUNT_EXOTIC] [TRAINABLE], [TRAINABLE_WAR], and [TRAINABLE_HUNTING] tokens are
not inappropriately applied. In addition, I have added either the [PET] or [PET_EXOTIC] token to a couple animals, several are now
available as domesticated animals on embark as a result of the changes, and siegers may show up with some new mounts. I have also
given a few birds the [DIVE_HUNTS_VERMIN] and [TRAINABLE_HUNTING] tokens where I felt it was fitting but they are not listed below.
Mainly intended to spice up fortress mode when used with the included mount_dwarf.lua script. All changes to these raws are denoted
by *XxHyde840xX* appearing at the end in their respective .txt files. The list of animals changed is as follows in no particular order.
You can Ctrl+F if you need to search up a specific animal from the list.

\hack\scripts

First, you need to get the dwarf you want as the rider, and the creature you want as the mount together in the same tile.
Then, activate the script in the DFHack console with the cursor over the tile. Next, go into the animals "z" menu screen
and hit "enter" to confirm. It helps if they're war-trained. To dismount and terminate the "connection" between rider and
mount, all you need to do is Pasture/Pen the creature. Realistically, there is nothing preventing you from mounting a dwarf
to a cat, or a gorlak to an owl, or a dwarf to a dwarf to a bear to a jabberer to a roc, but doing so may have unexpected 
effects. This script should, in theory also enable attackers to carry their riders off-map to siege, either counted both
as rider-mount, or seperately. They should also appear in sieges. I may potentially increasing the aggression for the
particular animals chosen for mounts by tweaking the raws in the future. If you'd like to make animals available for hunting
or war, all you need to do is add the [TRAINABLE_HUNTING], [TRAINABLE_WAR], or [TRAINABLE] tokens to the respective creatures,
or the [MOUNT] or [MOUNT_EXOTIC] token for Adventure Mode. Doing so will also, coincidentally, work on an existing savefile.
					 
Please ride responsibly, have fun, and make sure to thank Warmist, Fanfloosh, and Rumrusher for their work on the script.

Documentation & Usage: https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/User:Fleeting_Frames/max-wave

For clarification, you can and should modify this according to your personal preferences. Or you can just delete the script
if you don't intend on using it. Add the following to the end of your onMapLoad_PeridexisErrant.init file, minus the quotation marks.

"# This should fix migrant waves to 10 each, upto a max population
# of 200 dwarves.
repeat -time 1 -timeUnits months -command [ max-wave 10 200 ]"

You should replace the "10" and "200" in both the onMapLoad_PeridexisErrant.init and the max-wave.lua scripts with whatever you wish to set your
maximum migrant wave number at, and whatever your maximum population is according to the LNP. Don't worry, it's easy to do! The first number is your
"migrant wave," and the second number is your "max population."

You can find the onMapLoad_PeridexisErrant.init file in your Dwarf Fortress folder, and the max-wave script in your "\hack\scripts" folder.

If you have no need of this script, feel free to delete it. My mod does not rely on it.

As a bit of a lark, I've fished out a raw edit that allows everyone's favorite Elf-King to appear in other worlds as decorations and
engravings. Very rarely, he may even wind up in a list of what a particular dwarf likes. I've added a couple [ADJ] tokens to include the
fact that he punted a horse, and a few other tidbits. [TILE:69] should be the "E" tile, however it might be a bit wonky depending on what
tileset is currently installed. If so, try changing the tile number to whatever the respective tile for Elf is in that tileset. All credit goes
to Shima from the Dwarf Fortress Wiki for this one.

A relatively simple reaction, but fairly useful. Make a rock bin from the Craftsdwarf's Workshop out of some of that stone cluttering up your halls.
The reaction requires one boulder.  If this looks strange with a graphical tileset installed, please let me know and I will look into a custom tileset

My personal favorite out of the reactions I've created so far. The reaction is [AUTOMATIC],and enabled from the Wood Furnace. What this does is
take 5 vermin remains and cremate them, with a 25% chance of producing a Potash bar as a result. Feel free to ignore the reaction if you feel it's
"cheaty." I figure it may help with FPS decay over time by keeping those corpses to a minimum, provide something else productive for a woodburner to
do, help keep the fortress "sanitary" from an RP perspective, and provide newer players or those without the means to get a bit of fertilizer.
