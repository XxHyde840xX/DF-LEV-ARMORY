A relatively simple reaction, but fairly useful. Make a rock bin from the Craftsdwarf's Workshop out of some of that stone cluttering up your halls.
The reaction requires one boulder.  If this looks strange with a graphical tileset installed, please let me know and I will look into a custom tileset
for the new reactions and items.

	[CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION:A wondrous stone bed, fit for a dwarf. Requires leather for pillow and blankets. Mmmmm...comfy.]

Another simple reaction designed to provide another useful way to remove stone. Make a rock bed from two boulders and some leather.
Again, I'm not sure if this will look weird with a graphical tileset, so please let me know if that is the case.

	[PRODUCT:25:1:BAR:NONE:POTASH:NONE][PRODUCT_DIMENSION:150]

	[CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION:Automatically dispose of vermin remains, with a small chance to get a potash bar.]
	
My personal favorite out of the reactions I've created so far. The reaction is [AUTOMATIC],and enabled from the Wood Furnace. What this does is
take 5 vermin remains and cremate them, with a 25% chance of producing a Potash bar as a result. Feel free to ignore the reaction if you feel it's
"cheaty." I figure it may help with FPS decay over time by keeping those corpses to a minimum, provide something else productive for a woodburner to
do, help keep the fortress "sanitary" from an RP perspective, and provide newer players or those without the means to get a bit of fertilizer.
